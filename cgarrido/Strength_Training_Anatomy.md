## Shoulder Exercises 

### Shoulder Press

Characteristics: 

This is a compound exercise that targets the front of the deltoid, the triceps, and the upper-chest muscles. It can be done unilaterally with dumbbells or a machine. 

#### Presses With A Bar

Military Press:

The bar is placed in front of the head. The face (especially the chin and nose) interferes with the trajectory of the bar. To avoid this, people sometimes arch their back excessively. 

#### Presses With Dumbbells

Arnold Press:

What makes the Arnold Press such a great exercise is that it engages all three deltoid muscle heads: anterior (front), lateral (outer), and posterior (rear). The standard Shoulder Press typically focuses more on the anterior and lateral deltoid heads, but it fails to pay sufficient attention to the less-worked posterior head.

## Back Exercises 

### Row

Characteristics: 

This is a compound exercise for the back muscles as well as the biceps and forearms. Unilateral work is very popular for this exercise. It increases the range of motion a great deal. 

#### Rows With Dumbbells

Dumbbell Row:

The primary muscle group worked when doing dumbbell rows is the upper back. This includes the following:

- Latissimus dorsi - the flat triangular muscle that extends from the humerus (located in the upper arm, between the elbow and shoulder) to the mid-to-lower spine, near the bottom of the rib cage

- Posterior deltoid - the muscle on the back of the shoulder 

- Rhomboid - superficial muscles in the upper back that connect the scapula (shoulder blade) and upper spine

- Trapezius - extends from the back of the head and neck, down the spine, and out to the shoulder

## Lumbar Region Exercises 

### Deadlift 

Characteristics:

This compound exercise works not only your lumbar muscles, but also your latissimus dorsi, trapezius, buttocks, and thighs. Unilateral work on one leg is possible, but it requires a bit of acrobatics. 

## Chest Exercises

### Bench Press

Characteristics:

This compound exercise targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Unilateral work is possible, especially if you use a machine. 

#### Presses With A Bar

You can do bench presses using a bar in almost every gym or at home. But other than the availability of the equipment, using a bar has more drawbacks than advantages:

- The range of motion is determined by the size of your arms and rib cage, which might not match the optimal range of motion for your chest.

- When your hands are on the bar, they canot come together during the contraction (as they can when using dumbbells or a convergent machine). This restriction in the degree of contraction limits the development of the central part of the pecs. 

- Removing and replaceing the bar on the rack can be dangerous. If you are using a heavy weight, you shuould have a partner to help. 

#### Presses With Dumbbells

Dumbbells have numerous advantages over using a bar:

- The contraction is much better because you hands end up closer together. 

- The stretch can also be larger because there is nothing to stop the dumbbells in the lowest part of the movement. However, you must not overdo this two-sided stretch, because you could damage both your shoulder and the tendon attachments of the pectoralis major and the biceps. 

- You can use almost any hand and elbow position. Only dumbbells give you such a wide range of grip choices. 

## Biceps Exercises

### Curl (Supinated Grip)

Characteristics:

This exercise targets the biceps, and it works the brachialis and brachiordialis to a lesser extent. This is an isolation exercise. If your main goal is to have large biceps, you should do this exercise unilaterally. 

#### Curls With Dumbbells

This exercise is a good way to isolate the biceps. Dumbbells give your wrists freedom to move, and they help you avoid the kinds of injuries that can occur when using a straight bar or a machine. 

## Quadriceps Exercises

### Squat

Characteristics:

This is a compound exercise for the quadriceps, hamstrings, lumbar region, calves and buttocks.
