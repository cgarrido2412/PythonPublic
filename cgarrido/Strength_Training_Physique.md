# What does it take to build a *complete* physique?

## 6 Core Movements

### 1) Hip Hinge

Examples: Romanian Deadlifts, Conventional Deadlift

#### Romanian Deadlifts

Pros:
- Isolates posterior chain better than conventional deadlifts
- More controlled movement / better mind-muscle connection
- Active stretch

Cons:
- Takes longer to complete sets (slow tempo)
- Potentially not as "exciting" as conventional deadlifts

Other reasons for choosing Romanian Deadlifts over conventional would be the better balance between the eccentric and concentric parts of the movement. For conventional deadlifts with heavy weight, there's generally a quick pull for the concentric and complete drop for the eccentric. 

### 2) Leg Press

Examples: Bulgarian Split Squats, Barbell back squats, Sled Leg Press Machine

#### Bulgarian Split Squats
Pros:
- Unilateral
- More typical of everyday movements
- Active Stretch
- Can adjust quad/glute emphasis with foot position 

Cons:
- Takes time to learn technique 
- Can draw out workout duration 

### 3) Horizontal Push

Examples: Barbell Bench Press, Dumbbell Bench Press

### 4) Horizontal Pull

Examples: Seal Row, Bent Over Row, T Bar Row, Pendlay Row, Chest Supported Dumbbell Row

#### Barbell / Dumbbell Bench Press

No particular preference between the two. 

#### Chest Supported Low/Mid Row

Pros:
- No lower back tension so you can focus on the pull
- Less taxing than a free-standing barbell / T bar row

### 5) Vertical Push

Examples: Military Press, Seated Shoulder Press, Arnold Press

#### Unsupported Overhead Press

Pros:
- Reduces dependence on anterior deltoid
- Encourages greater range of motion (bringing bar to chest)

Cons:
- More taxing due to core bracing

### 6) Vertical Pull

#### Pullups

Pros:
- Hits almost all back muscle
- Harder to cheat than lat pulldown
- It's just officially sick to be decent at pullups

Cons: 
- More awkward to add weight to than machine pulldowns
- Can be limited by grip strength
