# What does it take to build a *complete* physique?

## 6 Core Movements

### 1) Hip Hinge

Examples: Romanian Deadlifts, Conventional Deadlift

#### Romanian Deadlifts

Pros:
- Isolates posterior chain better than conventional deadlifts
- More controlled movement / better mind-muscle connection
- Active stretch

Cons:
- Takes longer to complete sets (slow tempo)
- Potentially not as "exciting" as conventional deadlifts

Other reasons for choosing Romanian Deadlifts over conventional would be the better balance between the eccentric and concentric parts of the movement. For conventional deadlifts with heavy weight, there's generally a quick pull for the concentric and complete drop for the eccentric. 

### 2) Leg Press

Examples: Bulgarian Split Squats, Barbell back squats, Sled Leg Press Machine

#### Bulgarian Split Squats
Pros:
- Unilateral
- More typical of everyday movements
- Active Stretch
- Can adjust quad/glute emphasis with foot position 

Cons:
- Takes time to learn technique 
- Can draw out workout duration 

### 3) Horizontal Push

Examples: Barbell Bench Press, Dumbbell Bench Press

#### Barbell / Dumbbell Bench Press

Characteristics:

This compound exercise targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Unilateral work is possible, especially if you use a machine. 

**Presses With A Bar**

You can do bench presses using a bar in almost every gym or at home. But other than the availability of the equipment, using a bar has more drawbacks than advantages:

- The range of motion is determined by the size of your arms and rib cage, which might not match the optimal range of motion for your chest.

- When your hands are on the bar, they canot come together during the contraction (as they can when using dumbbells or a convergent machine). This restriction in the degree of contraction limits the development of the central part of the pecs. 

- Removing and replaceing the bar on the rack can be dangerous. If you are using a heavy weight, you shuould have a partner to help. 

**Presses With Dumbbells**

Dumbbells have numerous advantages over using a bar:

- The contraction is much better because you hands end up closer together. 

- The stretch can also be larger because there is nothing to stop the dumbbells in the lowest part of the movement. However, you must not overdo this two-sided stretch, because you could damage both your shoulder and the tendon attachments of the pectoralis major and the biceps. 

- You can use almost any hand and elbow position. Only dumbbells give you such a wide range of grip choices. 

### 4) Horizontal Pull

Examples: Seal Row, Bent Over Row, T Bar Row, Pendlay Row, Chest Supported Dumbbell Row

#### Chest Supported Low/Mid Row

Pros:
- No lower back tension so you can focus on the pull
- Less taxing than a free-standing barbell / T bar row

### 5) Vertical Push

Examples: Military Press, Seated Shoulder Press, Arnold Press

#### Unsupported Overhead Press

Pros:
- Reduces dependence on anterior deltoid
- Encourages greater range of motion (bringing bar to chest)

Cons:
- More taxing due to core bracing

Characteristics: 

This is a compound exercise that targets the front of the deltoid, the triceps, and the upper-chest muscles. It can be done unilaterally with dumbbells or a machine. 

**Presses With A Bar**

Military Press:

The bar is placed in front of the head. The face (especially the chin and nose) interferes with the trajectory of the bar. To avoid this, people sometimes arch their back excessively. 

 **Presses With Dumbbells**

Arnold Press:

What makes the Arnold Press such a great exercise is that it engages all three deltoid muscle heads: anterior (front), lateral (outer), and posterior (rear). The standard Shoulder Press typically focuses more on the anterior and lateral deltoid heads, but it fails to pay sufficient attention to the less-worked posterior head.

### 6) Vertical Pull

#### Pullups

Pros:
- Hits almost all back muscle
- Harder to cheat than lat pulldown
- It's just officially sick to be decent at pullups

Cons: 
- More awkward to add weight to than machine pulldowns
- Can be limited by grip strength
